# Introduction {#intro}
To get started it may be helpful to check out the
[getting started section in the README](https://github.com/nix-community/plasma-manager?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started).
This gives a couple examples on how you can get started using plasma-manager,
either using a flake or traditional nix-channels.

More details may be available here in the future!
