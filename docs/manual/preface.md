# Preface {#preface}

Plasma-Manager is a [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)
module which has as a goal to be able to configure as much of KDE plasma as
possible, using nix.

The project has progressed a lot lately, to the extent where
[most of the configuration options present in KDE Plasma 6 are configurable through plasma-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/plasma-manager#whats-supported).

The main focus of the project has been on KDE plasma 6 for a little while now,
but it's also possible to use it to some extent on plasma 5 as well.
